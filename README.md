# ðŸ”¥ BIG BANG Generator

There was a tale when two prime numbers (3 and 5) collided, and a BIGBANG occurred.

This script models that tale by generating an array from 1 to 100:
- "BIG" for numbers divisible by 3
- "BANG" for numbers divisible by 5
- "BIGBANG" for numbers divisible by both 3 and 5
- Otherwise, the number itself

## ðŸ§ª Output
Saves the array to `output.json`.

Example:
```json
["1", "2", "BIG", "4", "BANG", "BIG", "7", ..., "BIGBANG", ..., "100"]
